    <p>Computer programming language, any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. 
        Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, 
        after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some
         “higher-level” language. Although there are many computer languages, relatively few are widely used.

        Machine and assembly languages
        A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly.
         The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits (“bits”), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16)
          for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, 
          and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write,
           since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.
